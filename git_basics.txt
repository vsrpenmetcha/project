1. git version
git version 2.18.0.windows.1

2. Your Identity
The first thing you should do when you install Git is to set your user name and email address. 
This is important because every Git commit uses this information, and it’s immutably baked into the commits you start creating:

$ git config --global user.name "John Doe"
$ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
Again, you need to do this only once if you pass the --global option, 
because then Git will always use that information for anything you do on that system. 
If you want to override this with a different name or email address for specific projects, 
you can run the command without the --global option when you’re in that project.

Many of the GUI tools will help you do this when you first run them.

3.Checking Your Settings
$git config --list

user.email=vsrpenmetcha@gmail.com
user.name=Venkata Penmetcha

4. Initilialize git (initiliazed @ c:/work/python)

$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in C:/work/python/.git/

 -> goto C:/work/python, run ls -la the you will see

drwxr-xr-x 1 pvsri 197609    0 Aug 12 19:39 .git/ 

 -> .git folder has the required code to keep track of the files

 -> to untrack the files , remove .git folder

5. git help commands: 
   For example, you can get the manpage help for the git config command by running

  $ git help config

5. 

$ git status
On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        git_basics.txt
        ignorefile.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

 git_basics.txt, ignorefile.txt are untracked files

6. to ignore few files from git status, create .gitignore file and add file names that you want to ignore it

7.  git add .gitignore
    git add -A -> to all files to staging area

8. $ git reset .gitignore   -> git reset command will move that file form staging area to untracked file.

9. $ git commit -m "adding any file in .gitignore will ignore from git status "

10. $ git clone https://github.com/vsrpenmetcha/project temp/
